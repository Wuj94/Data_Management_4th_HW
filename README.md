# 4th Homework of Data Management course @ Sapienza University of Rome

## A ROLAP porting of an existing database

The author of the work is just myself, and I supposed this deployment environment:

* I have a supermarket relation DB and the business is expanding,
    We need to extract information from our data considering his now huge amount.
* The only provided information is:
    A Workbench .sql for mysql RDBM.

Basically, the work done was split in 3 iteration:
The work has been in part validated by the professor,
but it was not always the case.

I look forward to use a springMVC implementation of the validated-before 
architecture we would implement. If you want to collaborate, just contact me.
